      <p>The program, "The Company Officer Academy" is the result of numerous requests and discussions the chiefs have had with chief and company officers across the nation concerning company officer training and preparedness. Many departments simply promote a new company officer and send them to a new assignment with no formal training. This often results in creating a more stressful and challenging situation for the new officer and the unit.</p>
      <p>
      Chiefs John Salka and Rick Lasky have put together this dynamic multi-day program that addresses the many skills and abilities that company officers need to have to be effective in the firehouse and on the fire ground. This program is designed for new company officers, current officers and future officers.
