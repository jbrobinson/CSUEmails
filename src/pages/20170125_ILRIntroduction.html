Hello (%firstname%),

In an effort to improve and enhance learning, CSU is expanding the number of courses that utilize current, relevant resources. Integrated Learning Resources (ILR) courses may incorporate library resources, content area labs, lectures, approved faculty-created materials, or video presentations, and may have enhanced study guides or interactive materials.

The course or courses below contain Integrated Learning Resources, and no textbook is required. [Watch this video](\\florida.columbia.local\j-drive\Academics\Curriculum Development\Special Projects\RoundsVideos\RoundsILRVideo.mp4) to learn more about Integrated Learning Resources.

Each course unit contains a [study guide](http://www.columbiasouthern.edu/CSU2014/media/Email/OMEGA/Graphics/UnitI.png) that contains the unit lesson, and resources.

In addition, the [course syllabus](http://www.columbiasouthern.edu/CSU2014/media/Email/OMEGA/Graphics/Syllabus.png) contains assignment instructions, grading information, and tips on accessing required resources in the CSU Online Library.
